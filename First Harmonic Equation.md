### Frequency of the first harmonic

The speed of a wave travelling along a string with two fixed ends is given by, $v = \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$ 

Where,

T = tension in the string (N)

$\mu$ = mass per unit length of string ($kgm^{-1}$)

For the first harmonic of a stationary wave of length L, the wavelength, $\lambda = 2L$. There fore, according to the wave equation, the speed of the stationary wave is, $v = 2\lambda = f * 2L$.

combining these two equations leads tot he frequency of the first harmonic, $f = \frac{1}{2L}\sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$ 

Where f = frequency (Hz)

L = length of the string (m)
