F = ma is the base for a lot of equations in mechanics, this is why it is important that you know it.

This is the first of newtons laws of motion.

An object twill stay at rest and an object will stay in motion with constant velocity  will continue with the constant velocity, unless an unbalanced force acts on the object.
