- The baryon number is the number of baryons in an interaction
- It depends on whether the particle is a baryon, anti-baryon or neither
	- Baryons have a baryon number of +1
	- Anti-baryons have a baryon number of -1
	- Particles that are not baryons have a baryon number of B=0
- A baryon number is a quantum number and is conserved in all interactions 
	- This is one of the indicators for whether an interaction is able to occur or not

| B=1            | B=-1                                         | B=0 Measons | B=0 Leptons  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| P, n, $\Sigma$ | $\overline{\mbox{P}}$, $\overline{\mbox{n}}$ | $\pi$, K    | $e^-$, $\nu$ |

- The up (u), and down (d) and strange (s) quark have a baryon number of $\frac{1}{3}$
- This means that the anti-up, anti-down and anti-strange quarks have a baryon number of $-\frac{1}{3}$ 
- The implications of this is that baryons are made up of all quarks and anti-baryons are made up of all anti-quarks
- The are no baryons (yet) that have a combination of quarks and anti-quarks eg. up, anti-down, down
- The reason being that this would equate to a baryon number that is not a whole number (integer)

### The proton as a Baryon

- The proton is the most stable baryon
- This means it has the longest half-life of any baryon and is the particle which other baryons eventually decay to
- It is the most stable baryon because it is also the lightest baryon
	- Radioactive decay occurs when heavier particles decay into lighter particles
	- A decay of the proton would therefore violate the conservation of baryon number
- It is theorised that the proton has a half-life of around $10^{32}$ years and research experiments are still underway that are designed to detect proton decay.
