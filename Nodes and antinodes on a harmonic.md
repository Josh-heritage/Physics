A node is where the string is in a fixed point, with zero amplitude. An anti node is the opposite of that, the two point at maximum magnitude of amplitude.

This is an example of the 3rd harmonic.

Here is an image of 7 harmonics. The first one is the top one with two nodes and one antinode.

Note the ends count as nodes.
