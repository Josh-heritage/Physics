## Calculating Wavelength using E = equations

The equations to use are, E = hc$\lambda$ and $\lambda$ = hcE. Where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, h is the planks constant and E is the energy.

## Example

What is the wavelength of a photon that has an energy of $3.36*10^{-19}$ J?

$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{6.626*10^{-34}JS * 2.998*10^8ms^{-1}}{3.36*10^{-19} J} + 5.91*10^{-7}m = 591$
