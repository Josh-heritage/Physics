Energy conservation laws are are part of mechanics. they explain and define the total energy in a closed system. They can be used in momentum or efficiency questions.

## Definitions 
==Energy cannot be created nor destroyed==

==Energy can be transferred==
## Efficiency

![[Pasted image 20240924225215.png]]

The total energy going into the system must equal the total amount of energy going out of the system.

the formula for efficiency is $Efficiency = \frac{useful output power}{input power}$

To which if you then need it as a percentage, multiply it by 100.

## Examples

If a ball is thrown upwards, kinetic energy is converted into gravitational potential energy. When it comes down again, that gravitational potential energy is converted back into kinetic energy. This shows that the total energy in the system is conserved.

If an object is going down a slide, the gravitational potential energy is being converted into kinetic with very little being transferred to friction and therefore dissipated as heat.

In a perfect world, if someone is bouncing on a trampoline, the gravitational potential is flickering like a cosine wave, whereas the kinetic energy is flickering in the opposite. The middle step in between the two is the elastic potential. 

## Practice questions

**A Simple pendulum has a mass of 720g and a length of 50cm (to 2 s.f). It is pulled out at an angle of $30\degree$ (to 2 s.f) from the vertical. **

**a) Find the gravitational potential energy storred in the pendulum bob.**

**b) The pendulum is released. Find the maximum speed of the pendulum bob as t passes the vertical position.**


**a)** 
You can work out the increase in height, $\Delta h$, of the end of the pendulum using trig.
gravitational  potential  energy = $mg\Delta h$

= $0.72 * 9.81 * (0.5 - 0.5cos30\degree)$

= $0.43.. j$

= **$0.47j (two 2 s.f)$**

**b)**
To find the maximum speed, assume no air resistance, then $mg \Delta h = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$.
so $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ = 0.473...

Rearrange to find $v = \sqrt{\frac{2 * 0.473...}{0.72}} = 1.1 ms^-1$  (to 2 s.f)
