### Forces

Forces are caused by particle exchange.

Instantaneous action at a distance, according to Einstein, is no possible. When two particles interact something must happen to let the other particle know that an interaction has occurred. This is where exchange particles come in to play.

#### Repulsion
If you have two people on a zero friction surface, and an object is pushed from one person to another, both of the people get moved back a little. This is because the object carries the momentum from one person to another.

#### Attraction
If you have two people on a zero friction surface, both facing the opposite way, and they push an object which is attached by a chain to the centre. They will both be moved inwards.

####
These exchange particles which cause this are called gauge bosons.
The repulsion between two protons is caused by the exchange of virtual photons, which are the gauge bosons of the electromagnetic force. Gauge bosons are virtual particles. they only exist for a very short time.

### The Four Fundamental Particles

| Type of interaction | gauge Boson                       | Particles Affected     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Electromagnetic     | virtual photon (symbol, $\gamma$) | Charged particles only |
| Weak                | $W^+$, $W^-$                      | all types              |
| Strong              | Pions ($\pi^+$, $\pi^-$, $\pi^0$) | hadrons only           |
| Gravity             | Not applicable                    | Not applicable         |
Gravity is negligible as its so small compared to the other forces. It only matters when you've got big masses like stars and planets.

In terms of the strong nuclear force, pions are described as being exchanged between nucleons. It might also be seen as gluons being exchanged between quarks.

#### The large the mass of the Gauge Boson, the Shorter the Range of the Force.
1) The W boson have a mass of about 100 times that of a proton, which gives the weak force a very short range. Creating a virtual W particle uses so much energy that it can only exist for a very short time and it can't travel far.
2) On the other hand, the photon has zero mass, which gives you a force with an infinite range.
