To resolve forces in horizontal and vertical components you normally need to use trigonometry. 

A force acting on a direction needs to be resolved into two perpendicular forces.

This can be used to find the resultant force when two or more forces are acting on a point mass. You would have to resolve the two x and y forces of one and then the other force. Then you would combine the parallel forces and recalculate the resultant force.
