Newtons laws of motion are,

### A body will remain at rest or move with constant velocity unless acted on by a resultant force

### A resultant force acting on a body will cause a change in momentum in the direction of force. The rate of change in momentum is proportional to the magnitude of the force. (F = ma)

### If a body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert a force on body A of equal magnitude but opposite in direction.
