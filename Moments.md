A moment is a turning force.

The equation is 

$moment = Fd$

Where,

moment = turning effect in newton meters (NM)

F = force i newtons

d = perpendicular distance from the pivot in meters.

the force may not always be applied perpendicularly to the pivot.

However, the distance used in the equation must be the perpendicular from the pivot.

In these cases, the component of the distance that is perpendicular to the pivot must be used.
