The force which acts between nucleons in a nucleus is the strong nuclear force.

### Strong Nuclear Force
In a nucleus there are,
- Repulsive electrostatic forces between protons due to their positive charge
- Attractive gravitational forces due to the mass of the nucleons

Gravity is the weakest of the fundamental forces so it has a negligible effect compared to the electrostatic repulsion between protons.

If Gravity was the only force acting in the nucleus, the particles would not hold together.

Therefore there must be an attractive force acting between all nucleons which is stronger than the electrostatic force.

**This is the strong force**

This force acts between quarks which as both protons and neutrons are made of them, that's what holds it together.

The electrostatic repulsion acts almost as a body. This means that this force only really acts on external particles attempting to get close to it. Where as the strong force is the opposite and it only acts on the other particles inside the atom. 

The strength of the strong nuclear force between two nucleons caries with the serration between them.

Here, this image shows that the force between 0 fm and 0.5 fm are repulsive and between 0.5 fm and 3 fm is attractive.

The maximum attraction is around 1 fm and this is where most nuclear separations occur.

### Comparison of electrostatic and strong force

The graph below shows the electrostatic force and the strong force layered over the top of each other.

At separations between 0.5 fm and 3 fm, the attraction of the strong force is far more powerful than the repulsion of the electrostatic force. 

- the repulsive electrostatic force between protons has a much larger range than the strong nuclear force.
	- However, it only becomes significant when the proton separation is more than around 2.5 fm.
- This electrostatic force is influenced by charge, whereas the strong nuclear force is not. 
- This means the strength of the strong nuclear force is roughly the same between all types of nucleon.
	- This only applied for separation between 0.5 fm and 3 fm (where the electrostatic force between protons is insignificant)
- The equilibrium position for protons, where the electrostatic repulsive and strong attractive forces are equal, occurs at a separation slightly below 0.5 fm.
