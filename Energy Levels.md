## Line spectra & Energy Levels

Energy Levels can be represented as a series of horizontal lines,
- The line at the bottom with the greatest negative energy represents the ground state.
- The lines above the ground state with decreasing energies represent excited states
- The line at the top, usually 0V or infinity, represents the ionisation energy.

A photon is emitted when an electron moves from a higher energy state to a lower energy state. the energy of the emitted photon is equal to the difference in energy between the energy levels in the transition.

## Line Spectra 

Line spectra occur when excited atoms emit light of a certain wavelengths which correspond to different colours. The Emitted light can be observed as a series of lines with spaces in between, these series of lines are called line or atomic spectra.

Each Element produces a unique set of spectral lines, no two elements emit the same set of spectral lines. From this, elements can be identified by their line spectrum.

Each transition corresponds to a different wavelength of light and this corresponds to a line in the spectrum.

The resulting emission spectrum contains a set of discrete wavelengths, represented by coloured lines on a black background. Each emitted photon has a wavelength which is associated with a discrete change in energy, according to the equation, $\Delta E = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$


line spectra provides evidence that electrons in an atom can only transition between discrete energy levels.

#### Absorption Spectra

An atom can be raised to an excited state by the absorption of a photon.
When white light passes though a cool, low pressure gas, it is found that light of a certain wavelengths are missing. This type of spectrum is called an absorption spectrum.

An absorption spectrum consists of a continuous spectrum containing all the colours with dark lines at certain wavelengths.

These dark lines correspond exactly to the differences in energy levels in an atom. When these electrons return to lower level, the photons are emitted in all directions, rather than in the original direction of the white light. therefore some wavelengths appear to be missing.

The wavelengths missing from an absorption spectrum are the same as their corresponding emission spectra of the same element.

### Difference in  Discrete Energy Levels

The difference between two energy levels is equal to a specific photon energy. The energy (hf) of the photon is given by, $\Delta E = hf = E_2 - E_1$ 

Where $E_1$ is the energy of the higher level in joules,
$E_2$ is the energy of the lower level in joules,
h = Plancks's constant Js
f = Frequency of photons (Hz)

Using the wave equation, the wavelength. of the emitted, or absorbed, radiation can be related to the energy difference.

$\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_2 - E_1}$ this equation shows that the larger the difference in energy between two levels $\Delta E(E_2 - E_1)$ the shorter the wavelength $\Lambda$ and vice versa.
