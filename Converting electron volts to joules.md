## Relation between electron volts and Joules

Ev is short for electron volt and is a unit of energy. Joules, however, is a derived unit of energy from SI units. Electron volts are directly proportional to Joules.

| Electron volt | 1 Electron volt is the energy change that takes place when a charge is equal to 1 electron ($1.6*10^{-19}$ C) is moving though a potential difference of 1 volt. | 1eV = $1.602*10^{-19}$ J  |
| Joule         | 1 Joule is the work done or energy transferred on an object when a force of 1 newton acts on it in the direction of its motion along a distance of 1 meter.      | 1 J = $6.2415*10^{18}$ ev |


To convert electron volts to Joules, times it by $1.602*10^{-19}$ which is the magnitude of the charge of an electron.

To convert back, you times it by the reciprocal.
