This is an electricity equation.

Power is equal to force divided by velocity.

This can be used to calculate power exerted by a motor.

#### Worked example

If a truck is going up a $14.5\degree$ hill at $9.4ms^{-1}$ and the truck weighed 3500 kgs.

$F = mg sin(\theta) = 3500 * 9.81 * sin(14.5) = 8596.8 N$

P = 85596.8 * 9.4 = 80809.9 W = 81000W = 81kW (2.s.f)
