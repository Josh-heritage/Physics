### Derivation of v = f$\lambda$ 

Wavelength = $\lambda$ 

Frequency = f

Time = T

Speed = v

---

The speed of a particle on a wave is given by, $Speed = \frac{Distance}{Time}$

For a wave, $Wave\space Speed = \frac{Distance\space Traveled\space By\space The\space Wave}{Time}$ 

In one time period T, The wave Travels one full wavelength, $\lambda$

$v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$

From the definition of frequency,

$f = \frac{1}{T}$ 

$\therefore \space v = f\lambda$
