## Definition 

Specific charge is the ratio of an atom's mass to its electrical charge.

specific charge = $\frac{c}{m}$
## Facts

The magnitude of the specific charge of electrons is larger than the specific charge of protons because the proton is heavier than the electron.

The neutron has a specific charge of zero, as it has a neutral charge.

in an atom with an equal number of protons and electrons the specific charge is zero.

## Electrical charge

**Calculate the total charge of a helium nucleus.**

**$^4_2He$**

We need to multiply the charge of one proton by the total number of protons in the nucleus the proton charge is equal to $1.6022 * 10^{-19}$ coulombs, so we need to multiply the total number of helium protons, which is two, by the charge value.

Total charge = $2 * (1.6022 * 10^{-19}C) = 3.2044 * 10^{-19}C$ 


**Calculate the total charge of a carbon anion with eight electrons**

An anion is a negatively charged atom. A carbon atom normally has six electrons, but in this case, we are dealing with an atom that has two extra electrons and thus a total of eight. These additional electrons give the atom a negative total charge.

To obtain the total charge, we need to multiply the elctron charge value by the extra electrons. the electron charge is $-1.6022 * 10^{-19}C$. The total charge, therefore, is $-1.6022 * 10^{-19}C$ multiplied by two.

Total charge = $2 * (-1.6022*10^{-19}) = -3.2044 * 10^{-19}$

## Obtaining the mass

To obtain the total particle mass, we need to multiply the mass value of protons and neutrons by the number of protons and neutrons int he atom. The electron's mass is so small that we don't need to recalculate it. The approximate mass of both protons and neutrons is $1.67 * 10^{-27}$ although neutrons are slightly heavier.

## Specific charge

**Calculate the specific charge of a nucleus of Carbon 12**

$^{12}_6C$ 

To calculate the specific charge, we first multiply the charge of one proton by the total number of protons, which in the case of a carbon atom is six.

Total charge = $6 * (1.6022 * 10^{-19}C) = 9.6132 * 10^{-19}C$

now we multiply the mass of the particles that make up the nucleus by the particle's number, which in this case is twelve.

Total charge = $12 * (1.67 * 10^{-27}kg) = 20.04 * 10^{-27}$

Finally, you need to divide the two quantities.

Specific charge = $\frac{Electrical\space charge}{Particle\space mass}$
